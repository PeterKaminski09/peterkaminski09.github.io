        <p>You may or may not know that I love movies. I started following the Oscars when I was still in grade school—staying up late with my mom because they were on a school night in the dead of winter, and there wasn’t much else to do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Back then, I would usually only see one or two of the best picture nominees and get my hopes up that <i>Inception</i> or <i>Toy Story 3</i> would take home the prize. This wasn’t much fun; I felt like the odds were against me and my favorite movies. So back in 2016, I decided to start watching all of the best picture nominees before awards season. I was studying abroad in Ireland at the time, and I had all the spare time in the world. I started a radio show at the university, <i>Original Score</i>, that was dedicated to playing movie soundtrack music, and me and my cohost John would pass the time each week talking about the Oscars and our favorite movies.</p>

        <p>Trying to keep up with the nominees in Ireland was a test of patience, as movies that were released in the US months before were only made available later in Europe. But I made due, and my reward was being able to sit down to watch the Oscars at 1:30am with all the hopes and dreams in the world for <i>Lady Bird</i>, <i>Get Out</i>, Willem Dafoe, and Jonny Greenwood’s <i>Phantom Thread</i> score. I placed some modest bets at PaddyPower’s and stayed up until 4:30 watching and waiting to see if my due dilligence would pay off. (*Ron Howard's voice*: It didn't) </p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2018, I invested in a <i>MoviePass</i>, and probably ran them out of business paying $7.99 a month and going to see 5-6 movies every month in San Francisco, where movies usually cost $16.99. And after <i>MoviePass</i> shut down (may it rest in peace), I moved on to <i>AMC’s A List</i> subscription where I watched over 30 movies in 2019.</p>

        <p>Since graduating, I’ve been longing for a creative outlet, and I figured writing movie reviews could suit me pretty well. So here’s to trying a new thing in 2020. May the upcoming year follow in 2019’s footsteps.</p>
